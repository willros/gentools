### Setup ###

# Enter the directory containing the raw reads and a directory name that you want to use as a working directory

raw_reads: data_smallseq_10_files
working_directory: gentools_smallseq_10_files
threads: 6

### Preprocessing ###  

# The default configuration is optimized to work with miRNA data. Especially libraries prepared with the 
# Small-seq protocol. 

umi_tools_extract:
- input: raw
- mode: extract
- extract-method: regex
- bc-pattern: (?P<discard_1>.*)(?P<umi_1>[ACT]{8}CA)

# For trimmed only enter Y for yes and N for no if you want cutadapt to only keep reads that have been filtered.

cutadapt:
- input: umi_tools_extract
- adapter: TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGG
- minimum-length: 18
- maximum-length: 41
- error-rate: 0.1
- overlap: 1
- trimmed_only?: N

# enter folder and prefix of index name, e.g. index/human_genome/hg38

bowtie2:
- input: cutadapt
- k: 100
- local: very-sensitive-local
- x: /bowtie2_index/genome/GRCh38


umi_tools_dedup:
- input: bowtie2_aligned
- mode: dedup
- method: unique


# enter the path to the annotation file (a), GTF or GFF

featureCounts:
- input: bowtie2_aligned
- M:
- O:
- a: gencode.v39.annotation.gtf.gz

# Enter the coldata for the two conditions of the dataset. For example, cancer: 1 - 10, normal: 11 - 20

DESeq2:
- input: featureCounts
- coldata:
    - cancer: 1 - 10
    - normal: 11 - 20


# Write the programs in the order that you want to run them in. This order will be run by the run-pipe command.

order:
- umi_tools_extract
- cutadapt
- bowtie2
